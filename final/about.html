  <p class="bio">Gaming has been my passion ever since I was a toddler. However, when I first played Call of Duty Black Ops 1 in the 7th grade, I truly realized just how amazing video games were. Up until then I mainly played single player or offline multiplayer games. With an online multiplayer game, my experience with gaming truly changed. I became even more fiercely competitive and began to strive to become the best. With Modern Warfare 3, I began to start realizing my skills as a player. To back that up, I achieved the feat of ranking in 13th and 106th out of millions of players in two different game modes.</p>
