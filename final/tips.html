  <p>Call of duty is a very mechanically advanced game. The differences between good players and bad players are easily identifiable. Take a look at the clip below. I will break down and teach you 3 actions performed that gave me success in this clip. </p>

  <h2 class="headings">Tip 1: Target Prioritization</h2>

  <p>When entering an engagement with multiple enemies, it is important to know which enemy you should attack first. Choosing the wrong enemy will lead to a more difficult time surviving or out right death! Watch the clip below. Notice how despite seeing the first enemy on Flag B, I instead shoot at the target off to the right first. I do this in order to prevent that specific target from coming and killing me from the side once he notices that I have eliminated his ally. However, you may think that the enemy on Flag B would have simply killed me after eliminating the target on the right. This was not the case because I took into account the positioning and angles we had on each other. The enemy on Flag B had a much steeper angle on me, meaning he would have needed a longer time fixing his aim on me. In addition, simply back pedaling gives me the hill advantage causing the enemy to lose sight of me!</p>

  <h2 class="headings">Tip 2: Target Acquisition</h2>

  <p>Going hand in hand with target prioritization is target acquisition. When facing multiple enemies, it is important to cut down time in between switching targets by snapping in and out of ADS. Going into ADS drastically reduces aim sensitivity so it is important to leave ADS when changing targets in order to line up your gun with them as fast as possible!</p>

  <h2 class="headings">Tip 3: Swapping Weapons</h2>

  <p>The last, most simple, and yet most ignored action is swapping weapons. Primary weapons are vastly more powerful than secondary weapons, however this does not mean that secondary weapons are useless. As their name suggests, they are meant to come second in times of need. Going for the reload would have gotten me killed, as you can see the last enemy making a rush towards me. Rather than trying to reload my primary weapon, I quickly swap to my secondary weapon to efficiently dispatch my last target.</p>
