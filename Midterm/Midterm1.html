	<center><p class="text">The nervous system is the network of nerve cells and fibers that transmits nerve impulses between parts of the body. It consists of the brain, spinal cord, sensory organs, and nerves.<br> The nervous system sends information through out the body using electric signals; this is what the Flavor Chip uses as its advantage.<br> The Flavor Chip is able to modify these very electric signals thus changing the information being sent throughout your body. <br> This will effectivly allow one to modify the signals present when eating a certain food in order to produce a different signal carrying information for a different feel and flavor. </p></center>
